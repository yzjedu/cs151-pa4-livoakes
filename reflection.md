### Objective:
- **What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**
  - The objective was to create a program that analyzes news headlines by providing functionalities such as counting specific words, calculating averages, and identifying the longest and shortest headlines.

### Procedure:
- **What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**
     - First I determined the tasks/functions I was going to use within my program. Next, I designed my functions and
then implemented them into my program. Finally, I ran my program to see if it ran correctly and then went back to fix any errors.

- **What were the Key concepts explored?**
  - Reading from and writing to files, string manipulation, functions, and error checking.

### Results:
- **Did your results match what you expected to get?**
  - Yes, the results matched the expected outcomes.
- **Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**
  - Yes, I specifically tested it for errors.

### Reflection:
- **What challenges did you encounter?**
  - One challenge I came across was making sure that the program correctly handled file not found errors.
- **How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**
  - I tried to keep my code as simple as possible, while also testing it and providing comments within the code.

- **Did you overcome them, and how?**
  - Yes, I implemented error handling for files.
- **Any key takeaways?**
  - The importance of modular programming became clear, as breaking down the problem into functions made the code easier to manage and debug. I also learned the value of thorough testing in ensuring program reliability.

- **Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**
  - Yes, I definitely think I learned what I was supposed to for this Pa and I think it gave me a better understanding of the recent material we have learned in class.
- **What was it like working by yourself?**
  - I enjoyed working alone. I think I was able to focus better and it allowed me to fully understand the problem.
